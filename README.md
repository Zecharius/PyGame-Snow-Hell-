  Text(The name of the game we made is “SNOW HELL”. The objective of our game is to dash down the mountain and avoid all the obstacles in the way. Some obstacles in our game are trees, rocks, hidden traps, and explosives(TnT). At the end of each level you will reach a finish line. Once you reach the finish line, you will have to press the spacebar to advance to the next level. To avoid the obstacles in your way you will have to use the left and right arrow keys to navigate the dangerous mountains of “SNOW HELL”. At the the end of level 3 you will receive a golden medal, once you receive your medal the game is over and you’ve won the game of “Snow Hell”.)
